- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GogAidan
I am a new developer who recently has just graduated from a program called Object Oriented Software Development from SAIT Polytechnic in Calgary, Alberta.
In my time during this course we have done many minor and small projects. I have gained valuable experience in:

SQL & SQLite
ASP.NET MVC CORE
CSS
BootStrap 
HTML 
JavaScript
Java
Android

I also gained valuable skills in being able to adapt and learn new languages or procedures, as this course we studied these varying things in a short amount of time.


You can find me on LinkedIn! the best way to contact me is through email at aidangoguen@outlook.com or through my LinkedIn page at www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-goguen
